          <p>
          I'm a Cinematographer and Video editor with personality who worked with major brodcasting companies. Also Working for an ad agency definitely has some glamorous perks but it's also a great place to develop new skills and take on interesting challenges. I produced (shoot & edit) a few music video which was tough but also beneficial to my career and worked closely with a few great artists. </p>

              <p>
          I love technologies and I am trying to be up to date. I love to code and program gadgets to talk to eachother and becasue of that I believe my future is in learn different languages as much as I can to become a success developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the passed I have used lots of page builder tools and platform to create websites such as Wordpress, Joomla & Wix etc but Now I'm trying to hand-craft beautiful websites as well as web applications and more.
 <p>Coding is fun also challenging and the more you challenge yourself the more you learn. 
        </p>
              <p>
                It is awesome to having fun while learning 😃
